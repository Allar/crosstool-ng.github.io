title: New domains
---
A few days ago (see the third entry, below), I wrote about a little surprise.
In fact, I now own the [crosstool-ng.org](http://crosstool-ng.org) and
[crosstool-ng.net](http://crosstool-ng.net) domains! :-) I will make them
point to the new server as soon as I understand how DNS works... (they are
parked for now...)
