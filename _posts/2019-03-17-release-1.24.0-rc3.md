Note the <a href="/docs/configuration/">upgrade procedure</a> introduced with this release.

Also note that support for Alpine Linux as a host is also experimental and will break
in many configurations (particularly, `*-linux-gnu`).

With this release candidate, a limited set of samples builds on all configurations
present in `testing/docker/` except Alpine. I will restart the full test on Monday;
hopefully in a week or so we'll have 1.24.0 release out the door.
