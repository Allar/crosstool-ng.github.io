Below is some semblance of the release notes:

An <a href="/docs/configuration/">upgrade procedure</a> for configurations created
in the previous release of crosstool-NG has been introduced with this release.

MacOS is not officially supported in this release.

Support for Alpine Linux as a host is experimental and is known to break
in many configurations (particularly, `*-linux-gnu`): GLIBC fails to compile on
a host using MUSL C library when it tries to create some helper applications
to run on the build machine.

CentOS 6 and 7, while still supported, are known to break with recent GDB releases
as they require a modern C++ compiler. The G++ included in CentOS 6/7 distributions
does not satisfy GDB requirements. Also, "Build and install locales" option in
GLIBC cannot be used on CentOS 6/7 build machines: this option requires GLIBC
to built for the build machine, and recent GLIBC releases fail to compile on
CentOS 6/7.
