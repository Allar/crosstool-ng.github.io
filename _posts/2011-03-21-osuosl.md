title: New hosting
---
The [OSUOSL](http://osuosl.org/) has agreed to host the crosstool-NG project!
Big thanks to them! I am working with them on setting up the VM that will be
hosting the project. This means: better bandwidth, better availability,
fixed IPv4 (v6 coming later), mailing lists, and so forth... If you have a few
bucks in your pocket, [please support OSUOSL](http://osuosl.org/donate) for
they are very helpful and dedicated to hosting FLOSS projects! And very soon,
another little surprise... Shh... ;-)
