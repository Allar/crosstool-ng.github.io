title: "New IP address"
---
The server now has a new IP address, and should now be reachable again;
just let the DNS caches expire, so the new address propagates. The root cause
is as of yet unknown, but hopefully, this will not happen anymore. Thanks
to the OSUOSL guys for their help in solving this issue!
