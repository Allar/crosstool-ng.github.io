title: macOS is no longer supported
---
With me (Alexey) being the only active maintainer, it is no longer possible
to debug any issues arising on macOS systems. I do not have a macOS system, and
Apple's license does not allow one to install an image of macOS into a VM to
do this kind of development work.

I am hereby declaring macOS unsupported. Any issues reported for macOS build/host
triplets will be closed. I am willing to review/pick up the pull requests for
addressing macOS issues - so long as they do not cause regressions in supported
host/build environments.
