  Thank you for making a non-trivial task simple. CT-NG is an excellent tool
  and extremely easy to use. I have been using it to create toolchains for the
  405 and it is an unbelievable time saver. Very well designed and implemented.

  First of all thanks for the nice work. I successfully build a arm9tdmi
  toolchain (after some minor problems) with gcc4.2.2 / glibc2.6.

  Thanks for your reponse. Let me just say... i am VERY happy with crosstool-ng
  so far, thank you so much the time and effort you spent on it, it is simply
  awesome.

  We are successfully using your crosstol-ng for creating small embedded
  gnu/linux distribution, that we use in ticket selling terminal, slot
  machines, online pay terminals and probably will use somewhere else. We've
  tried a lot of similar tools, but only this one has clear and user friendly
  documentation, and is very easy in use.

  Firstly I would like to say thanks for your excellent tool, saves me a
  *lot* of time and effort. We use it to generate the cross compielrs
  for the ARM linux Linux Kernel autobuilder: http://armlinux.simtec.co.uk/kautobuild/

  Our company has been using crosstool-NG for some time now. Thanks for
  great toolchain builder! Before crosstool-NG we used our own builder.

  Thank you very much for crosstool-ng! Certainly, a very useful tool
  for building cross-compilers.

  We have been using crosstool-NG consistently in our company over 2 years
  to produce cross-toolchains for x86_64 targets. These toolchains have
  compiled milions of lines of code so far without any problem.
